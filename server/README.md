## JesDb backend

Backend runs on supabase.

You can [self-host](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting/docker) supabase or host on [supabase](https://supabase.com/).

Set up tables etc. with `schema.sql` and seed tables with data from `seed.sql`.
At the moment, seed file does not include all example rows found in production version
